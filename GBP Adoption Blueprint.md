Base off lessons learned to start 

Barriers to entry - Discovery 

• TLAs confusing 

• City Plan 

• Divisional views of capabilities rather than a GBP view 

• Docs split over GitHub, FD Confluence, PPB Confluence 

• What’s current vs what’s target 

• Codebase map inventory out of date 

• Includes decommissioned TLAs 

• Getting access to resources and tooling has been challenging 

 

Operational Model – Security/Patching 

•CentOS versions 

•Spring versions 

•Path to upgrade 

 

Inherent Coupling to PPB 

•Data Feeds 

•IAP Auth 

•AlFresco 

 

 

Things we know we need to address 

•Coherence cache 

•Currency Support 

•Outbound Event Hierarchy Feed 

•Wallet API Model

Start here 

 

Engagement from who and to who? From: Divisional CTO? Directors of Tech? 

To: Paul Cutter, Conor Lynch, Tiago?? 

Hi, what's GBP, why would I want it, does it suit me? (Phil creating a GBP sales one pager) 

Or is it a higher level action outside GBP? - Strategically why you should consider this, now go engage Flutter Tech/GBP 

  

Move into GBP team engagement 

Action – GBP Overview slides and presentation from GBP team. Now you know, do you want to know more? 

Action – Follow up helicopter session(s) as needed until division is convinced to engage their tech leads on more discovery 

Action – Share GBP documentation? Is it still too low level here without a map or a documentation 'sherpa'?  Can we have something more summarized and digestible before we drop the full github doc tree?  

 

Action – Slightly lower level GBP Product based session with people closer to their own capabilities? Or Product teams?? As a product this is what's on offer, here is what is core/extension/dependency 

 

Action – Start to highlight integration and option points: You need a wallet and a Front end, you can use these other features also or use your own...? Etc etc, there's more 

 

Action – Look at high level bi-directional gap analysis, what does the division stand to gain in features, product, capability, what might it lose? Is there a cost analysis needed at some point? High level 

 

 

Internal 'customer' project pitch (internal to the division, they need to pitch it to their own stakeholders) 

Are we good to move on with a project? 

 

 

Things to consider 

Here’s the menu of core, extensions and options. What's our scope here? 

Identify and what unique Product requirements you have that might need to be looked at first for suitability or pre-engagement. Technical, Regulatory, pre-existing licensing or contractual considerations, time considerations, resourcing etc (Role of the BA, Solution Designers etc) 

Architectural approach design and planning needed. Integrations etc 

Resourcing. Clarity on who needs to do what 

You need a delivery team to manage the implementation, analyze, install, configure, integrate and run the platform 

We, the GBP/Impl team will provide guidance, support and assistance on the processes, options and SME contacts 

You need to decide on hosting solution, then source and enable the infra, we can help guide and show best practice 

You need to source your operational teams post go live 

You need to provide your SME's to hook up with the platform SME's for knowledge transfer 

 

Clarity on third party considerations, OB relationship, technology licensing needed etc  

 

Is the platform, it's features, limitations and requirements suitable for your adoption? If yes 

Do we need to share some indicative timelines? Based on X's adoption of Y feature set with Z resources you need to allocate 10 months etc? 

Set up suite of capability level KT workshops with relevant customer stakeholders, get some time estimates and start making a project plan... 

Capability workshops for caps that need re-designing and work. Different focus  

 

From our side we need to consider how to engage Cap Owners, SME's and all non 'customer' resources, especially other divisional. Let them know there's a new adoption on the horizon   

 

Need a defined process for how we engage with non-adpoting divisions where we need work from them to tweak or enhance the product 

 

 

 

NOTES*** 

There are a list of known integration points, call them out for workshops 

Product gap analysis to be classified, must have's need immediate workshops 

Flag caps that need a change vs caps that don’t, different workshops and approaches
